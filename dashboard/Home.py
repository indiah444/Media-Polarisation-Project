    ## üìä Understanding Polarised Media Coverage and Sentiment
                
    In today's highly polarised media landscape, news outlets often present different
    narratives on the same event, making it challenging to assess the neutrality
    of the information you consume.
                
    Our <span style='color:red; font-weight:bold;'>**Media Polarisation Dashboard**</span> is designed to help you navigate this
    ever-changing terrain by providing insights into how different media sources
    from across the political spectrum cover key topics. 
                
    Through this dashboard, you can:
    - Compare <span style='color:blue; font-weight:bold;'>**topic coverage**</span> between various news outlets.
    - Analyse the <span style='color:red; font-weight:bold;'>**sentiment**</span> of articles from different sources.
    - Understand <span style='color:blue; font-weight:bold;'>**how frequently**</span> topics are covered and observe <span style='color:red; font-weight:bold;'>**shifts over time**</span>.
    - Visualise differences in <span style='color:blue; font-weight:bold;'>**media framing**</span>, empowering you to make more informed decisions about the information you trust.
                
    ## üîç How It Works
                
    This dashboard aggregates data from a range of news outlets, analysing articles for both <span style='color:red; font-weight:bold;'>**sentiment**</span> and <span style='color:blue; font-weight:bold;'>**frequency of coverage**</span>.
    We perform hourly updates using RSS feeds from these sources, and the data is then processed to determine how positively or negatively each topic is discussed.
    Additionally, you can <span style='color:red; font-weight:bold;'>**subscribe**</span> to daily or weekly email updates, ensuring you stay informed on how the media landscape evolves.
                
    ## üöÄ Explore the Data
