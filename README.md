# Media Polarisation Project

## Problem Statement

In today's society, the media landscape is highly polarised. Different groups of people often receive radically different information or narratives depending on the media sources they consume. This divergence in coverage can make it difficult for the public to trust any particular source or easily identify bias. This project aims to address the challenge of understanding media bias across different outlets.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a service that tracks and analyses how different media outlets cover various topics. The service will allow users to compare the frequency and sentiment of topic coverage between different media sources, enabling them to see not only _what_ is being covered, but also _how_ it is being discussed. This will provide valuable insights into media bias and narrative framing, helping users make more informed decisions about the information they consume.
